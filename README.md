# About
Cyfer is a private **Discord** bot and the successor of **Botterino**. It does exactly what you would expect from a bot.
This project is written in `Javascript`, using `Eris` as the API to communicate between Discord and the bot itself. However, I don't recommend using `Eris` anymore as it lacks features compared to other alternatives such as `Discord.js`
# Help
You can view the changelog and commands on the bot's wiki page [here](https://github.com/AzzaDeveloper/cyfer-bot/wiki).

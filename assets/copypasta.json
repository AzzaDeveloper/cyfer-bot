That's funny, that's a cool reference. But I kept going, I'd see a fridge that looked like among us, I'd see an animated bag of chips that looked like among us, I'd see a hat that looked like among us. And every time I'd burst into an insane, breath deprived laugh staring at the image as the words AMOGUS ran through my head. It's torment, psychological torture, I am being conditioned to laugh maniacly any time I see an oval on a red object. I can't fucking live like this... I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't! And don't get me fucking started on the words! I'll never hear the word suspicious again without thinking of among us. Someone does something bad and I can't say anything other than \"sus.\" I could watch a man murder everyone I love and all I would be able to say is \"red sus\" and laugh like a fucking insane person. And the word \"among\" is ruined. The phrase \"among us\" is ruined. I can't live anymore. Among us has destroyed my fucking life. I want to eject myself from this plane of existence.`",

Your silver fanboys might like you, but I'd fuck you up on the rift. I'm only plat and I already get much better scores. Drop your smug little smile, kid.`",

I'll tell you what, my name is fucking Dante from Devil May Cry:tm:, and that play was done with me dying in the name of stylish. Listen. I do not do wrong combos. All of my deaths are in fact, planned and designed to make my kdr a perfect 0.69420. You probably can't even play Samira.
